## Flutter commands

### flutter pub get

The `flutter pub get` command gets the latest versions of all the packages listed in your project's `pubspec.yaml` file. This command is usually run when you first create a new Flutter project, or when you update your dependencies.

### flutter run -d all

The `flutter run -d all` command runs your Flutter app on all of the connected devices and emulators. This is useful for testing your app on different devices and platforms.

## Nodejs commands

### cd server

The `cd server` command changes the current directory to the `server` directory. This is useful if your project has multiple directories, and you want to work on the server code.

### npm install

The `npm install` command installs all of the dependencies listed in your project's `package.json` file. This command is usually run when you first create a new Nodejs project, or when you update your dependencies.

### npm start

The `npm start` command starts your Nodejs app. This command will usually run the app in development mode, which means that it will automatically restart the app if you make any changes to the code.
